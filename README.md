# nz_covid_pass_reader

A Flutter application that reads, verifies and outputs the information contained in NZ COVID Passes.

By default it does not verify test passes.  Change `allowTestIssuers` to `true` in the `_ApplicationPageState` class to enable these.

## Implementation

Taken from the [NZ COVID Pass Technical Specification v1](https://nzcp.covid19.health.nz/).
